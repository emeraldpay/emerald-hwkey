== DER Signature Format

Bitcoin uses DER (Distinguished Encoding Rules) encoded ECDSA signatures in transactions. This is a subset of the ASN.1 BER encoding rules that ensures canonical encoding.
A DER signature consists of:

----
0x30 [total-length] 0x02 [R-length] [R] 0x02 [S-length] [S]
----

.Where:
- `0x30` is a tag for signature
- `total-length` is the total length of the remaining signature data
- `0x02` is the INTEGER tag for R and S components
- `R-length` and `S-length` are the lengths of the R and S components
- `[R]` and `[S]` are the actual signature components
